      Hey Geeky! Welcome to Mission Zero! <br />
      In this mission, you'll get your hands on some basic web designing using HTML, CSS, and Javascript!
      <br /><br />
      Your first mission is to come up with a self-introduction page on CodePen(here)!
      <br />
      Tell us more about yourself - who you are, your hobbies, any projects you've worked on, any fun facts about you!
      <br />
      Feel free to go wild on this page and show us what you've got!
      <br /><br />
      The best pages (our judges are waiting to see your cool works!) will score some points.. which may be helpful during GeekOut! 😏😏
    </p>
